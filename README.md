# Predicting Student At-Risk Status Using Early-Semester Data and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying students at risk of academic failure using early-semester data.  The analysis leverages machine learning techniques to process academic performance indicators and demographic information, allowing for proactive interventions to improve student retention and graduation rates.  The model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, and the results are presented through both console output and visualizations.


## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.  Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Example Output

The script will print key performance indicators and model evaluation metrics to the console.  Additionally, it will generate several visualization files (e.g., plots showing model performance, feature importance, etc.) in the `output` directory.  These visualizations provide a visual representation of the model's findings and help in understanding the factors contributing to student at-risk status.  The exact filenames and content of the output files may vary depending on the data and model used.
